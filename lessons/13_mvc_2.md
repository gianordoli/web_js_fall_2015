## Lesson 13: MVC 2

### Lecture

##### Frameworks vs Libraries

* A framework is a set of code libraries and data-structures, that provide generic functionality which can be used, overridden or further specialized.
* Compared to libraries, a framework is going to do more for you than a simple code library would. It's going to provide more structure, dictate the flow control of the program, and have a lot of default behaviours built in.
* Libraries typically don't do anything, until you ask them to. The framework is actually going to do a lot, on its own, as a default behavior.

##### Frameworks vs Templating Engines

##### Project #3 proposal

The 3rd project is very open-ended, so the sooner you start to think about it, the better. Again, try to sketch a rough diagram of your application. List the requirements and constraints of your project. Describe a use case and the general interaction flow.
