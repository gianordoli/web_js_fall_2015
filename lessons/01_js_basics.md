## Lesson 1: JavaScript Basics

### Overview

We will start by going through the syllabus and discussing your expectations for the class. Then we will learn a bit about JavaScript's history, uses, and properties.  
The working session will cover the basics of JS and some things that are important to keep in mind — specially compared to other languages.

### Lecture

#### Intro: What this course is about

* The course is focused in **JavaScript**, not HTML or CSS. Though it is not possible to simply ignore those, we will not spend time learning in-depth CSS selectors, for example — it is expected that of students a basic knowledge of those languages.
* Javascript has spread out to a lot of different areas (more about it later). Although, the focus of this course is **WEB** (front-end and server-side).
* This course won't turn you into a professional developer. Our focus is to build functional prototypes instead. I'll cover best practices as much as possible, but don't expect to produce industry-level code.
* We'll see lots of different libraries and we might add a few more along the way. Don't get obsessed about the most up-to-date tool out there though. Instead, try to get comfortable with something and take the best out of it.

#### 1. What is JavaScript?

* Developed for Netscape by Brendan Eich, released in 1995.
* Out of curiosity, Eich is the Mozilla CEO who stepped down after an anti-gay marriage controversy.
* Originally named *Mocha*, changed to *LiveScript* and finally released as *JavaScript*.
* The name was a marketing move, Java was very popular.
* In spite of the name the syntax is derived from C, not Java.
* The development of AJAX (asynchronous JavaScript and XML) and open source libraries (like JQuery), and the death of Flash resulted in a renaissance period for the language.

#### 2. Why JavaScript? 
More and more JavaScript has been used for purposes other than front-end development.

* Games: [Unity](https://unity3d.com/)
* Mobile apps: [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/)
* Server-side applications: [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)

#### 3. JavaScript Properties
	
* Loosely-typed
* Object-oriented (Prototypal)
* Functional
* Scripting language

#### 4. JavaScript Tricky Parts

* No Block-level Scope
* Global Namespace

### Homework

Create a word-count app. It must receive any text input through the console and return a list of words and their counts.  
**Bonus:** make it interact with an API.  
**Super:** implement a more complex text analysis, like [TF-IDF](http://shiffman.net/teaching/a2z/analysis/#tfidf).
