## Lesson 3: Single-page Application

In this lesson we will add more features to our simple Web App from lesson #2. We will build a Single-Page Application, using a template engine. Our data model for now will be a simple list of numbers stored locally.

### Lecture

#### Intro to MVC

* As our application grows in complexity, appending elements with JQuery turns out laborious and not effficient.
* *Show my own examples* â€” This might be ok if you're working by yourself! But...
* The biggest problem with this structure is that the structure and the logics are all embedded into one file. Say you're developing JS for a team, where another person is doing CSS. By simply looking into the html, your colleague has no way of telling what the page is doing. Also, he/she can't assign classes to anything without opening your file and skimming through the code just to find the html part.
* Separating the logics from the rendered result is one of the principles of the architectural pattern Model-View-Controller (MVC).

#### Templates

For now we'll use template engines. Not the same as MVC, but they'll help us get used to its logics.

* [Mustache](https://mustache.github.io/), [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/), [Underscore](http://underscorejs.org/#template)
* Templates work based on a process called [Data Binding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_binding).
